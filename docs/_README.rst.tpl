Manage Bitcoin Core daemon with Salt.

This formula currently downloads the releases from ``https://bitcoincore.org/bin`` by default and requires the source hash file be signed at least by a single trusted key. You can choose who to trust, the inbuilt keys are taken from the official list `found here <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/builder-keys/keys.txt>`_, but you can add others as well. I would like to add the feature of compiling bitcoind from source at some point.

This formula is currently quite basic. If you are looking for much more comprehensive and by default more secure solution, check out `nix-bitcoin <https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin>`_.

Mind that the test suite is currently of cosmetic nature, i.e. not implemented yet.

General notes
-------------

See the full `SaltStack Formulas installation and usage instructions
<https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html>`_.

If you are interested in writing or contributing to formulas, please pay attention to the `Writing Formula Section
<https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html#writing-formulas>`_.

If you want to use this formula, please pay attention to the ``FORMULA`` file and/or ``git tag``,
which contains the currently released version. This formula is versioned according to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.

See `Formula Versioning Section <https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html#versioning>`_ for more details.

If you need (non-default) configuration, please refer to:

- `how to configure the formula with map.jinja <map.jinja.rst>`_
- the ``pillar.example`` file
- the `Special notes`_ section

Special notes
-------------
* There is a `configuration generator <https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/>`_ for Bitcoin Core, which can help in setting up your desired config.
* It is recommended to store the chainstate database (~5GB currently) on a storage medium with high random access speed for optimal performance (e.g. SSD). You can split the blocks archive (~400GB currently) from the datadir to save space on that medium. This can be set in ``lookup:paths:blocks``.

Configuration
-------------
An example pillar is provided, please see `pillar.example`. Note that you do not need to specify everything by pillar. Often, it's much easier and less resource-heavy to use the ``parameters/<grain>/<value>.yaml`` files for non-sensitive settings. The underlying logic is explained in `map.jinja`.

Commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Commit message formatting is significant!**

Please see `How to contribute <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is configured for this formula, which you may optionally use to ease the steps involved in submitting your changes.
First install  the ``pre-commit`` package manager using the appropriate `method <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_, then run ``bin/install-hooks`` and
now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on each ``git commit``. ::

  $ bin/install-hooks
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

State documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a script that semi-autodocuments available states: ``bin/slsdoc``.

If a ``.sls`` file begins with a Jinja comment, it will dump that into the docs. It can be configured differently depending on the formula. See the script source code for details currently.

This means if you feel a state should be documented, make sure to write a comment explaining it.
